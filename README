This https://github.com/semk/cricinfo python library  found in the blog http://foobarnbaz.com/lab/ made me think about creating a similar one in Java. I created a simple library class and its implementation for this purpose. It works based on the http://www.espncricinfo.com/ site's rss feed.




Usage
---------

Download the two java sources files to a directory, FOLDER


now goto terminal type,


cd FOLDER

javac *.java

java CricDisplay

note: edit CricDisplay.java file and uncomment the proxy support if needed
